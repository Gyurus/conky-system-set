echo "🐛 BUG FIXES COMPLETED - MULTI-MONITOR SUPPORT"
echo "=============================================="
echo ""

echo "✅ ISSUES RESOLVED:"
echo "=================="
echo ""

echo "🔧 1. MONITOR SELECTION FLOW:"
echo "   Problem: Monitor selection prompt appeared before detection display"
echo "   Solution: Separated informational output (stderr) from interactive input"
echo "   Result: Clean, logical flow - detection → display → selection"
echo ""

echo "🔧 2. SED SUBSTITUTION ERROR:"
echo "   Problem: 'unterminated s command' error during template substitution"
echo "   Solution: Added proper variable escaping for special characters"
echo "   Result: Robust template processing with any monitor names/values"
echo ""

echo "🔧 3. TEMPLATE SYNTAX ERRORS:"
echo "   Problem: Complex bash scripts in template causing Conky syntax errors"
echo "   Solution: Simplified embedded scripts, removed problematic constructs"
echo "   Result: Clean Conky startup without 'Unterminated quoted string' errors"
echo ""

echo "🔧 4. INTERACTIVE PROMPT ISSUES:"
echo "   Problem: read -p command interfering with output redirection"
echo "   Solution: Split into separate echo and read commands with proper redirection"
echo "   Result: Interactive mode works correctly in all scenarios"
echo ""

echo "🔧 5. VARIABLE PARSING VALIDATION:"
echo "   Problem: No validation of monitor configuration parsing"
echo "   Solution: Added debug output and validation checks"
echo "   Result: Clear error messages when parsing fails"
echo ""

echo "📊 TESTING RESULTS:"
echo "=================="
echo ""

echo "✅ Multi-monitor detection: Working"
echo "✅ Single monitor fallback: Working" 
echo "✅ Interactive selection: Working"
echo "✅ Non-interactive mode: Working"
echo "✅ Template substitution: Working"
echo "✅ Conky startup: Working"
echo "✅ All positioning options: Working"
echo ""

echo "🧪 VALIDATION PERFORMED:"
echo "========================"
echo ""

echo "• Monitor detection on 2-monitor setup"
echo "• Position calculations for all 5 options"
echo "• Configuration parsing and validation"
echo "• Template substitution with special characters"
echo "• Conky syntax validation and startup"
echo "• Interactive and non-interactive modes"
echo "• Error handling and fallback scenarios"
echo ""

echo "🚀 CURRENT STATUS:"
echo "=================="
echo ""

echo "🌳 Branch: feature/multi-monitor-support"
echo "🐛 All reported bugs: FIXED"
echo "✅ Error handling: Enhanced"
echo "✅ User experience: Improved"
echo "✅ Stability: Verified"
echo ""

echo "📋 WHAT WAS BROKEN:"
echo "=================="
echo "- Monitor selection flow was confusing"
echo "- sed command failed with special characters"
echo "- Conky had syntax errors on startup"
echo "- Interactive prompts were misaligned"
echo ""

echo "📋 WHAT IS NOW WORKING:"
echo "======================"
echo "- Clean monitor detection and selection flow"
echo "- Robust template substitution for any values"
echo "- Error-free Conky configuration generation"
echo "- Perfect interactive and automated modes"
echo "- Comprehensive error handling and validation"
echo ""

echo "🎯 READY FOR:"
echo "=============="
echo "• Production deployment"
echo "• Testing on various hardware configurations"
echo "• Merge to main branch"
echo "• User distribution"
