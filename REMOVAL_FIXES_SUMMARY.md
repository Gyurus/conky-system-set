echo "üîç ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED:"
echo "================================"
echo ""

echo "‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE 1: Missing Update System Files"
echo "   Problem: Script didn't clean up new update system files"
echo "   Files:   ~/.conky-system-set-skip-version"
echo "            ~/.conky-system-set-last-check"
echo "   Status:  ‚úÖ FIXED - Added cleanup in main removal process"
echo ""

echo "‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE 2: Backup Files Accumulation"
echo "   Problem: 96 backup files found with no cleanup mechanism"
echo "   Pattern: *.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.backup files"
echo "   Impact:  User systems become cluttered with old backups"
echo "   Status:  ‚úÖ FIXED - Added smart backup detection & removal"
echo ""

echo "‚ùå ISSUE 3: Script Self-Removal Timing"
echo "   Problem: 'Text file busy' errors when removing script while running"
echo "   Method:  Direct rm command during execution"
echo "   Status:  ‚úÖ FIXED - Safe background removal with 2-second delay"
echo ""

echo "‚ùå ISSUE 4: Directory Logic Inconsistency"
echo "   Problem: Only checked for empty directories, not conky-specific files"
echo "   Impact:  Could leave conky files if directory had other content"
echo "   Status:  ‚úÖ FIXED - Smart file detection for conky vs. non-conky files"
echo ""

echo "‚ùå ISSUE 5: Autostart Directory Handling"
echo "   Problem: No validation for empty autostart directory cleanup"
echo "   Impact:  Could leave empty directories or remove important ones"
echo "   Status:  ‚úÖ FIXED - Added intelligent autostart directory validation"

echo "üéØ Backup File Detection:"
echo "   Pattern: [filename].[YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS].backup"
echo "   Method:  Regex matching with user prompts"
echo "   Safety:  Individual confirmation for each file"

echo "üéØ Self-Removal Fix:"
echo "   Old:     Direct rm command (causes Text file busy)"
echo "   New:     Background process with delay"
echo "   Command: (sleep 2; rm -f script) &"

echo "üéØ Directory Intelligence:"
echo "   Logic:   Count conky vs. non-conky files"
echo "   Action:  Remove only if safe or conky-only"
