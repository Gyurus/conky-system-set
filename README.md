**conkyset.sh** is a simple Bash script to automate the installation and setup of Conky with a custom configuration on Linux systems.

## Features

- Installs Conky if not already present
- Installs required tools (e.g., `wget`, `pip`) â€” additional dependencies may be required depending on your Linux distribution; check the script for details.
- Downloads a pre-configured Conky setup archive from git
- Extracts and installs the configuration to `~/.config/conky`
- Sets up an autostart entry 
- runs Conky immediately after setup

## Usage

1. **Download the files**  
   Save them to your home directory or any folder.

2. **Make it executable**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x conkyset.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**  
   ```bash
   ./conkyset.sh
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts**  
   The script will ask if you want to create an autostart entry and if you want to run Conky now.
