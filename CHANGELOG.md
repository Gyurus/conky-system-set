# Changelog

All notable changes to Conky System Set are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.8.3] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed
- **Critical Installer Bug**: Fixed stdin reading when installer is piped from curl
- Script now properly redirects stdin from `/dev/tty` when not running in a terminal
- Resolves issue where `read` commands would fail during `curl ... | bash` installation
- User prompts now work correctly in piped installation scenarios

### Technical Details
- **Problem**: When running `curl -fsSL ... | bash`, stdin is consumed by curl, causing `read` commands to fail
- **Solution**: Added automatic stdin redirection from `/dev/tty` if not running in a terminal
- **Impact**: Without this fix, installer would hang or exit at first user prompt
- **Now**: Interactive prompts work correctly even when piped from curl

### Removed
- 10 redundant markdown documentation files (content preserved in CHANGELOG.md)

## Migration Guide

### From v1.8 to v1.8.1

If you installed v1.8 and chose to copy scripts (option 1), you may have module loading errors.

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gyurus/conky-system-set/main/fix-modules.sh | bash
```

**Manual Fix:**
```bash
# Remove copied scripts
rm ~/conkyset.sh ~/conkystartup.sh ~/rm-conkyset.sh

# Create proper symlinks
ln -sf ~/.conky-system-set/conkyset.sh ~/conkyset.sh
ln -sf ~/.conky-system-set/conkystartup.sh ~/conkystartup.sh
ln -sf ~/.conky-system-set/rm-conkyset.sh ~/rm-conkyset.sh
```

### From v1.6 to v1.8+

**Recommended: Fresh Installation**
```bash
# Remove old installation
~/rm-conkyset.sh

# Install v1.8.1
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gyurus/conky-system-set/main/install-online.sh | bash
```

**Benefits of Upgrading:**
- Online installation and updates
- Better multi-monitor support
- Improved removal process
- Enhanced error handling
- Automatic update notifications

## Development Notes

### v1.8.1 Critical Fix Background

**Problem Identified:**
When users selected "copy to home directory" during installation, the scripts were copied to `~/conkyset.sh` but the modules stayed in `~/.conky-system-set/modules/`. Since the scripts use `$(dirname "$0")/modules/` to find modules, copied scripts looked for `~/modules/` which didn't exist.

**Root Cause:**
The installer defaulted to copying files (option 1) instead of creating symlinks. This broke the relative path resolution used by the scripts.

**Solution:**
- Changed default to symlinks (preserves directory structure)
- Added warnings for copy option
- Created repair script for affected installations
- Enhanced documentation with troubleshooting guide

**Impact:** 
All users who chose default option (copy) in v1.8 experienced complete functionality loss. v1.8.1 prevents this by making symlinks the default and warning about copy option.

### v1.8.0 404 Fix Background

**Problem Identified:**
Online installer returned 404 errors when trying to download files from GitHub.

**Root Cause:**
- All v1.8 code was developed on `feature/multi-monitor-support` branch
- Installer defaults to `BRANCH="main"`
- Files didn't exist on main branch
- Tags v1.8 and v1.8.1 pointed to feature branch

**Solution:**
- Merged feature branch into main via fast-forward merge
- Deleted and recreated tags on main branch
- Verified all URLs return HTTP 200
- Added comprehensive documentation

**Impact:**
No users could successfully run the online installer until this fix was deployed.
